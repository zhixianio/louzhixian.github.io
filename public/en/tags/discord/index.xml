      <description>&lt;p&gt;The promised second tutorial is here. In just a few days since my last update, Moltbot has renamed itself again—the pace of the AI era is truly relentless. Even faster than the name changes is the wave sparked by moltbook, with all kinds of agent-oriented products emerging left and right, opening my mind to the early shape of a new era. But let&amp;rsquo;s not get into that today; let me first fill in the gaps from before and share my experience and insights on using OpenClaw through Telegram and Discord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My &#34;Doomsday Cabin&#34;: Building an AI Workbench with Discord</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re someone actively exploring the AI era, you should have your own Discord Server.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I call my Discord Server the &amp;ldquo;Doomsday Cabin.&amp;rdquo; The name might sound a bit dramatic, but it&amp;rsquo;s genuinely my most relied-upon work environment right now. &amp;ldquo;Doomsday&amp;rdquo; is a mental anchor I set for myself—the imagery helps me imagine being in the quiet of a wilderness, having one place I know still works, storing everything important to me. No matter how noisy or fast-changing things get outside, I still have a quiet place to continue working, thinking, and iterating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
