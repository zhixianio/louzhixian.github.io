In just a few days since my last update, Moltbot has renamed itself again—the pace of the AI era is truly relentless. Even faster than the name changes is the wave sparked by moltbook, with all kinds of agent-oriented products emerging left and right, opening my mind to the early shape of a new era. But let&amp;rsquo;s not get into that today; let me first fill in the gaps from before and share my experience and insights on using OpenClaw through Telegram and Discord.&lt;/p&gt;</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://zhixian.io/posts/agent-trainer-discord-guide/cover.png"/></item><item><title>Agent Trainer Case Study: Building Your Own Writing Workflow with Clawdbot</title><link>https://zhixian.io/en/posts/agent-trainer-writing-workflow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhixian.io/en/posts/agent-trainer-writing-workflow/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With Clawdbot&amp;rsquo;s rebranding to @moltbot, the initial excitement has started to fade.

&lt;p&gt;First, they heard about something called Clawdbot—looks like a lobster?—and thought: What is this? Why is everyone sharing it? Why don&amp;rsquo;t I have it yet? So they frantically read articles and ordered a Mac mini. Then came the analysis posts saying this thing is extremely dangerous, has way too many permissions, absolutely terrifying—uninstall it now! So everyone nervously uninstalled, shut down, wiped their systems, and listed their machines on secondhand markets (maybe the 🦞 got sold too, haha).&lt;/p&gt;</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://zhixian.io/posts/agent-trainer-security-clawdbot/cover.png"/></item><item><title>Agent Trainer's Guide: Clawdbot Setup &amp; Lessons Learned</title><link>https://zhixian.io/en/posts/agent-trainer-guide-clawdbot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhixian.io/en/posts/agent-trainer-guide-clawdbot/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Clawdbot suddenly blew up recently, which I find both surprising and inevitable. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Clawdbot for three weeks now, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly excited every single day because it genuinely feels like science fiction has become reality. Friends who follow me probably noticed I was pretty hyped those first few days—and those who chatted with me definitely felt it, haha.&lt;/p&gt;</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://zhixian.io/posts/agent-trainer-guide-clawdbot/cover.png"/></item><item><title>Rediscovering Peace of Mind in DeFi: The Design Principles Behind Owlia</title><link>https://zhixian.io/en/posts/introduce-owlia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 22:38:39 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://zhixian.io/en/posts/introduce-owlia/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeFi has become more powerful, but also more complex.&lt;br&gt;
Users are not lacking tools — they are lacking a partner who can carry some of the burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past months, my team and I have been working on something I believe is deeply important:
an Agent that can genuinely accompany you in the DeFi world — &lt;strong&gt;Owlia&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
