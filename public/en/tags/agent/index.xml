      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever asked your AI agent to modify its own config, only to watch it break itself? Then you spent an hour fixing it? Ever wanted a multi-agent Discord setup but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the config right no matter how many tutorials you read?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Advanced Agent Training: Multi-Agent Configuration in OpenClaw</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After several days of intense work, I finally finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://botdrop.app&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34;&gt;botdrop.app&lt;/a&gt;—a tool for running OpenClaw on Android—and now I have time to fill in some gaps. Have you been finding new ways to play with your 🦞 lately? I feel like this wave has truly spread everywhere; even friends who normally don&amp;rsquo;t care about tech are asking me about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agent Trainer Advanced Guide: Building an Efficient OpenClaw Collaboration System with Discord</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The promised second tutorial is here. In just a few days since my last update, Moltbot has renamed itself again—the pace of the AI era is truly relentless. Even faster than the name changes is the wave sparked by moltbook, with all kinds of agent-oriented products emerging left and right, opening my mind to the early shape of a new era. But let&amp;rsquo;s not get into that today; let me first fill in the gaps from before and share my experience and insights on using OpenClaw through Telegram and Discord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agent Trainer Case Study: Building Your Own Writing Workflow with Clawdbot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Clawdbot&amp;rsquo;s rebranding to @moltbot, the initial excitement has started to fade. I wonder how many people have drifted back to their daily lives, and how many have stayed behind as &amp;ldquo;new species&amp;rdquo; left by the receding tide, ready to explore this new continent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels like AI enthusiasts have been on an emotional roller coaster these past few days:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, they heard about something called Clawdbot—looks like a lobster?—and thought: What is this? Why is everyone sharing it? Why don&amp;rsquo;t I have it yet? So they frantically read articles and ordered a Mac mini. Then came the analysis posts saying this thing is extremely dangerous, has way too many permissions, absolutely terrifying—uninstall it now! So everyone nervously uninstalled, shut down, wiped their systems, and listed their machines on secondhand markets (maybe the 🦞 got sold too, haha).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clawdbot suddenly blew up recently, which I find both surprising and inevitable. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Clawdbot for three weeks now, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly excited every single day because it genuinely feels like science fiction has become reality. Friends who follow me probably noticed I was pretty hyped those first few days—and those who chatted with me definitely felt it, haha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeFi has become more powerful, but also more complex.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Users are not lacking tools — they are lacking a partner who can carry some of the burden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past months, my team and I have been working on something I believe is deeply important:&#xA;an Agent that can genuinely accompany you in the DeFi world — &lt;strong&gt;Owlia&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
