      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Clawdbot&amp;rsquo;s rebranding to @moltbot, the initial excitement has started to fade. I wonder how many people have drifted back to their daily lives, and how many have stayed behind as &amp;ldquo;new species&amp;rdquo; left by the receding tide, ready to explore this new continent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels like AI enthusiasts have been on an emotional roller coaster these past few days:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, they heard about something called Clawdbot—looks like a lobster?—and thought: What is this? Why is everyone sharing it? Why don&amp;rsquo;t I have it yet? So they frantically read articles and ordered a Mac mini. Then came the analysis posts saying this thing is extremely dangerous, has way too many permissions, absolutely terrifying—uninstall it now! So everyone nervously uninstalled, shut down, wiped their systems, and listed their machines on secondhand markets (maybe the 🦞 got sold too, haha).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clawdbot suddenly blew up recently, which I find both surprising and inevitable. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Clawdbot for three weeks now, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly excited every single day because it genuinely feels like science fiction has become reality. Friends who follow me probably noticed I was pretty hyped those first few days—and those who chatted with me definitely felt it, haha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
